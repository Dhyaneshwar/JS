## Classes

A class in a program is a definition of a type of custom data structure that includes both data and behaviors (methods) that operate on that data.
Classes define how a data structure works, but classes are not themselves concrete values.
To get a concrete value that you can use in the program, a class must be **instantiated** (with the `new` keyword) one or more times.

Consider:

```
class Page {
    constructor(text) {
        this.text = text;
    }
    print() {
        console.log(this.text);
    }
}

class Notebook {
    constructor() {
        this.pages = [];
    }
    addPage(text) {
        var page = new Page(text);
        this.pages.push(page);
    }
    print() {
        for (let page of this.pages) {
            page.print();
        }
    }
}

var mathNotes = new Notebook();
mathNotes.addPage("Arithmetic: + - * / ...");
mathNotes.addPage("Trigonometry: sin cos tan ...");

mathNotes.print();
```

| Class      | Data                           | Behavior                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Page`     | `this.text` - a string of text | `print()` - dumps the text to the console                             |
| `Notebook` | an array of `Page` instances   | `addPage()` - instantiates new `Page` pages and adds them to the list |

The `class` mechanism allows packaging data (`text` and `pages`) to be organized together with their behaviors (`print()` and `addPage()`).

- `mathNotes = new Notebook()` creates an instance of the `Notebook` class,
- `page = new Page(text)` creates an instance of the `Page` class.

Behavior (methods) can only be called on instances (not the classes themselves), such as `mathNotes.addPage(..)` and `page.print()`.

### Class Inheritance

```
class Publication {
    constructor(title,author,pubDate) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.pubDate = pubDate;
    }

    print() {
        console.log(`
			Title: ${ this.title }
			By: ${ this.author }
			${ this.pubDate }
		 `);
    }
}
```

This `Publication` class defines a set of common behavior that any publication might need.

Now let's consider more specific types of publication, like `Book` and `BlogPost`:

```
class Book extends Publication {
    constructor(bookDetails) {
        super(
            bookDetails.title,
            bookDetails.author,
            bookDetails.publishedOn
        );
        this.publisher = bookDetails.publisher;
        this.ISBN = bookDetails.ISBN;
    }

    print() {
        super.print();
        console.log(`
			Publisher: ${ this.publisher }
			ISBN: ${ this.ISBN }
		`);
    }
}

class BlogPost extends Publication {
    constructor(title,author,pubDate,URL) {
        super(title,author,pubDate);
        this.URL = URL;
    }

    print() {
        super.print();
        console.log(this.URL);
    }
}
```

Both `Book` and `BlogPost` use the `extends` clause to _extend_ the general definition of `Publication` as the additional behavior. The `super(..)` call in each constructor delegates to the parent `Publication` class's constructor for its initialization work, and then they do more specific things according to their respective publication type.

Now consider using these child classes:

```
var YDKJS = new Book({
    title: "You Don't Know JS",
    author: "Kyle Simpson",
    publishedOn: "June 2014",
    publisher: "O'Reilly",
    ISBN: "123456-789"
});

YDKJS.print();
// Title: You Don't Know JS
// By: Kyle Simpson
// June 2014
// Publisher: O'Reilly
// ISBN: 123456-789

var forAgainstLet = new BlogPost(
    "For and against let",
    "Kyle Simpson",
    "October 27, 2014",
    "https://davidwalsh.name/for-and-against-let"
);

forAgainstLet.print();
// Title: For and against let
// By: Kyle Simpson
// October 27, 2014
// https://davidwalsh.name/for-and-against-let
```

Both child class instances have a `print()` method, which was an override of the _inherited_ `print()` method from the parent `Publication` class. Each of those overridden child class `print()` methods call `super.print()` to invoke the inherited version of the `print()` method.

The fact that both the inherited and overridden methods can have the same name and co-exist is called **polymorphism**.
