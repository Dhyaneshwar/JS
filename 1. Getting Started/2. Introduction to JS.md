# Javascript

- JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, multi-paradigm language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.

## Multi Paradigm Programming

The term "paradigm" in programming language refers to a approach to structuring code.

1. **Procedural** style organizes code in a top-down, linear progression through a pre-determined set of operations, usually collected together in related units called procedures.

2. **Object-Oriented** style organizes code by collecting logic and data together into units called classes.

3. **Functinal** style organizes code into functions (like map, filter, reduce, etc.).

Some languages are heavily slanted toward one paradigmâ€”

- C is procedural,
- Java/C++ is Object oriented, and
- Haskell is Functional Programming.

But **_Javascript_** support code patterns that can come from different paradigms. So it is called "multi-paradigm languages" and it offer ultimate flexibility.

You can write procedural, class-oriented, or FP-style code, and you can make those decisions on a line-by-line basis instead of being forced into an all-or-nothing choice.
