# Javascript

- JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, multi-paradigm language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.

## Multi Paradigm Programming

The term "paradigm" in programming language refers to a approach to structuring code.

1. **Procedural** style organizes code in a top-down, linear progression through a pre-determined set of operations, usually collected together in related units called procedures.

2. **Object-Oriented** style organizes code by collecting logic and data together into units called classes.

3. **Functional** style organizes code into functions (like map, filter, reduce, etc.).

Some languages are heavily slanted toward one paradigm—

- C is procedural,
- Java/C++ is Object oriented, and
- Haskell is Functional Programming.

But **_Javascript_** support code patterns that can come from different paradigms. So it is called "multi-paradigm languages" and it offers ultimate flexibility.

You can write procedural, class-oriented, or FP-style code, and you can make those decisions on a line-by-line basis instead of being forced into an all-or-nothing choice.

## Backward & Forward Compatibility

- Backward compatibility means that once something is accepted as valid JS, there will not be a future change to the language that causes that code to become invalid JS.

- Code written in 1995—however primitive or limited it may have been!—should still work today.

- The idea is that JS developers can write code with confidence that their code won't stop working unpredictably because a browser update is released.

- As TC39 members often proclaim, **"We don't break the web!"**

  > **_TC39_** is a group of JavaScript developers, implementers, and academics, collaborating with the community to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript.

- Forward compatibility means that including a new addition to the language in a program would not cause that program to break if it were run in an **older JS engine**. **JS is not forwards-compatible**.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th align="left">Note:</th>
	</tr>
	<td>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, by contrast, are <b>forwards-compatible</b> but <b>not backwards-compatible</b>.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you dug up some HTML or CSS written back in 1995, it's entirely possible it would not work (or work the same) today.
			</li>
			<li>
				But, if you use a new feature from 2019 in a browser from 2010, the page isn't "broken" -- the unrecognized HTML/CSS is skipped over, while the rest of the HTML/CSS would be processed accordingly. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Markup (HTML) or styling (CSS) are declarative in nature, so it's much easier to "skip over" unrecognized declarations with minimal impact to other recognized declarations.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</td>
</table>

- If a programming language engine selectively skipped statements that it didn't understand, it's impossible to ensure that a subsequent part of the program wasn't expecting the skipped-over part to have been processed.

### Providing Forward Compatibility

- Since JS is not forwards-compatible, if you run a program that uses an ES2019 feature in an engine from 2016, you're very likely to see the program break and crash.

- If the feature is a new syntax, the program will in general completely fail to compile and run, usually throwing a syntax error. (refer to **transpiler**)

- If the feature is an API (such as ES6's `Object.is(..)`), the program may run up to a point but then throw a runtime exception and stop once it encounters the reference to the unknown API. (refer to **polyfill**)

#### 1. Transplier

- Transpiling is a process where we use a software/tool to convert the source code of a program from one form to another.

- Forwards-compatibility problems related to syntax are solved by using a transpiler (the most common one is **Babel**) to convert from that newer JS syntax to an equivalent older syntax.

##### Example 1

JavaScript before year 2020 didn’t have the “nullish coalescing operator” `??`.

```
// before running the transpiler
	height = height ??  100;

// after running the transpiler
	height =  (height !==  undefined  && height !==  null)  ? height :  100;
```

##### Example 2

- For example, a developer may write a snippet of code like:

```
	if (condition) {
	    let x = 3;
	    console.log(x);
	}
	else {
	    let x = 4;
	    console.log(x);
	}
```

- This is how the code would look in the source code tree for that application.

- But when producing the file(s) to deploy to the public website, the Babel transpiler might convert that code to look like this:

```
	var x$0, x$1;
	if (condition) {
	    x$0 = 3;
	    console.log(x$0);
	}
	else {
	    x$1 = 4;
	    console.log(x$1);
	}
```

- An equivalent program (with minimal re-working) produced by Babel choose two different variables (x$0, x$1), producing the same non-interference outcome.

#### 2. Polyfill

- A **polyfill** is a piece of code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

- It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations.

- For example, `Math.trunc(n)` is a function that “cuts off” the decimal part of a number, e.g `Math.trunc(1.23)` returns `1`.

- In some (very outdated) JavaScript engines, there’s no `Math.trunc`, so such code will fail.

- As we’re talking about new functions, not syntax changes, there’s no need to transpile anything here. We just need to declare the missing function using polyfill.

##### Example

```
    // if no such function
    if (!Math.trunc) {
        Math.trunc = function(number) {
            // Math.ceil and Math.floor exist even in ancient JavaScript engines
            return number < 0 ? Math.ceil(number) : Math.floor(number);
        };
    }
```

Transpilers like Babel typically detect which polyfills your code needs and provide them automatically for you. But occasionally you may need to include/define them explicitly, which works similar to the snippet we just looked at.

## Is JS interpreted or compiled?

Interpreted languages are executed in a top-down and line-by-line fashion:-

![Interprter](/Assests/Images/Interpreter.png)

In interpreted languages, an error on line 5 of a program won't be discovered until lines 1 through 4 has already been executed.
Notably, the error on line 5 might be due to a runtime condition, such as some variable or value having an unsuitable value for an operation (e.g. divide by zero error).

In a parsing language, we do a set of processing step (called parsing) before any execution occurs.

In this parsing language, an invalid command (such as broken syntax) on line 5 would be caught during the parsing phase, before any execution has begun, and unlike interpreted language, none of the programs would run.

![Compiled](/Assests/Images/Parsing.png)

Once a source program has been fully parsed, it will be converted from the parsed form of the program — called an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** — to that executable form.

JS source code is parsed before it is executed. The syntax and semantic errors of the code are expected to be reported before the code starts executing. Those errors cannot be recognized without the code having been parsed.

The parsed JS is converted to an optimized (binary) form, and that "code" is subsequently handled to the "JS virtual machine" for execution.

So **JS is a compiled language**.
