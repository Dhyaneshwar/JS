## Compiled Language:

- A compiled language is a programming language that is converted from a high-level language into machine code so that the computer can execute it.
- This conversion is done by the compiler which scans the complete code only once and reports the errors collectively that the code might have.
- **Example:** C, C++, COBOL, etc.

## Interpreted language:

- An interpreted language is a programming language that is directly executed by the computer without any conversion to the machine-level language.
- The interpreter will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and halts at that very instance if there is some error.
- **Example:** JavaScript, Python, PHP, etc.

## First-Class functions:

A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function, and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

## Programming Languages:

- Programming languages are high-level languages that need to be converted into machine-level language because a computer can only understand machine-level language or binary language (0 and 1).
- Programming languages are most widely used to make software or drivers.
- **Examples:** Java, C, C++, C#.

## Scripting Languages:

- Scripting languages are basically the subcategory of programming languages that need to be interpreted instead of compiled.
- Scripting languages are most widely used to create a website.
- **Examples:** JavaScript, PHP, Perl, etc.

## What is Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using tools and techniques that are available to us by following some approach.

They are discussed below:

1. Imperative Programming
2. Declarative Programming

### Imperative Programming vs Declarative Programming

Imperative programming focuses on how to get to the end result, while declarative programming focuses on what is the end result.
A simplified **example to distinguish** between an imperative and declarative approach is to think of giving driving directions.

> **Imperative:-** When a person asks for the route for a specific location, you tell him how to get there by providing turn-by-turn directions.
> **Declarative:-** When you jump in a taxi, you just tell the driver the address of the location where you want to go.

#### Examples:

1. Write a function to double the values of all the elements in an array:-

```
> Imperative Approach
	function doubleAnArray(arr){
		let result = []
		for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
			result.push(arr[i]*2);
		}
		return result;
	}

> Declarative Approach
	const doubleAnArray = arr.map(ele => ele * 2);
```

2. Write a function to all the elements in an array:-

```
> Imperative Approach
	function sumOfArray(arr) {
		let result = 0
		for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
			result +=arr[i];
		}
		return result;
	}

> Declarative Approach
	const sumOfArray = arr.reduce((arr,ele) => ele + 2, 0);
```

### Imperative Programming

- In imperative programming, every step is coded and the code will specify **_how_** the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on.
- Because the written code performs the function, the programmer must code each step rather than relying on models that are able to solve it.
- Example:- C, C++, C#, Java, etc.

#### 1. Procedural programming paradigm

- The procedural programming paradigm is where program code is divided up into procedures, which are discrete blocks of code that carry out a single task.
- Example: Refer to the example codes above (that belong to imperative approach)

#### 2. Object-oriented programming paradigm

- The program is written as a collection of classes and objects which are meant for communication.

#### 3. Parallel processing approach

- Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors.
- A parallel processing system posses many numbers of processor with the objective of running a program in less time by dividing them.
- This approach seems to be like divide and conquer.
- Examples- NESL, C, C+, etc.

### Declarative Programming

- Declarative programming is a method to encapsulate the logic required for code to perform an action and instead focuses on **_what_** the desired outcome is.
- Declarative models rely on preconfigured capabilities, i.e. methods and library, in the language to accomplish a task without explicit step-by-step instruction on how to do it.
- Example:- HTML, SQL, CSS, etc.

#### 1. Logic programming paradigms

- Logic programming is a programming paradigm that is largely based on formal logic.
- Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.

#### 2. Functional programming paradigms

- Functional programming means using functions to the best effect for creating clean and maintainable software.
- More specifically, functional programming is a set of approaches to coding, usually described as a programming paradigm.
- Example:- Javascript, Haskell, etc.

#### 3. Database/Data driven programming paradigms

- Data-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required
- Example: `Select * from employee`
