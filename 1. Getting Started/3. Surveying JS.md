### Primitive values in JS

In addition to strings, numbers, and booleans, two other _primitive_ values in JS programs are `null` and `undefined`. (both values serve the purpose of indicating _emptiness_ or _absence_ of a value).

### Arrays

Besides primitives, the other value type in JS is an **object value**. Arrays are a special type of object that's comprised of an ordered and numerically indexed list of data:

```
var names = [ "Frank", "Kyle", "Peter", "Susan" ];
names.length; // 4
names[0]; // Frank
names[1]; // Kyle
```

Arrays can hold any value type, either primitive or object (including other arrays).

### Objects

Objects are an unordered, keyed collection of various values. For example:

```
var me = {
    first: "Kyle",
    last: "Simpson",
    age: 39,
    specialties: [ "JS", "Table Tennis" ]
};

console.log(`My name is ${ me.first }.`);
// My name is Kyle.
```

## var, let and const

Variables have to be declared (created) to be used. Variables are just a container for values.

The `var` keyword declares a variable to be used in the program and allows an initial assignment of a value.

```
var myName = "Kyle";
var age;
```

Another similar keyword is `let`:

```
let myName = "Kyle";
let age;
```

The `let` keyword has some differences from `var`, with the most obvious being that `let` allows more limited access to the variable than `var`. This is called **_block scoping_**.

**Block-scoping** is very useful for limiting how widespread variable declarations are in our programs, which helps prevent accidental overlap of their names.

Consider:

```
var adult = true;
if (adult) {
    var myName = "Kyle";
    let age = 39;
    console.log("Shhh, this is a secret!");
}
console.log(myName); // Kyle
console.log(age); // Error!
```

The attempt to access `age` outside of the `if` block results in an error, because `age` was block-scoped to the `if`, whereas `myName` was not.

A third declaration form is `const`. It's like `let` but has an additional limitation that it must be given a value at the moment it's declared, and cannot be re-assigned a different value later.

Consider:

```
const myBirthday = true;
let age = 39;

if (myBirthday) {
    age = age + 1;    // OK!
    myBirthday = false;  // Error!
}
```

The `myBirthday` constant is not allowed to be re-assigned.

`const` declared variables are not "unchangeable", they just cannot be re-assigned.

#### const with Object type

It's ill-advised to use `const` with object values because those values can still be changed even though the variable can't be re-assigned. This leads to potential confusion down the line like:

```
const actors = [
    "Morgan Freeman", "Jennifer Aniston"
];

actors[2] = "Tom Cruise";   // OK :(
actors = [];                // Error!
```

### Value Type Determination

For distinguishing values, the `typeof` operator tells you its built-in type, if primitive, or `object` otherwise:

```
typeof 42;                  // "number"
typeof "abc";               // "string"
typeof true;                // "boolean"
typeof undefined;           // "undefined"
typeof null;                // "object" -- oops, bug??
typeof { "a": 1 };          // "object"
typeof [1,2,3];             // "object"
typeof function hello(){};  // "function"
```

| WARNING                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `typeof null` unfortunately returns `"object"` instead of the expected `"null"`. Also, `typeof` returns the specific `"function"` for functions, but not the expected `"array"` for arrays. |

Converting from one value type to another, such as from string to number, is referred to in JS as **coercion**.

### Interpolation

```
console.log("My name is ${ firstName }."); // My name is ${ firstName }.

console.log('My name is ${ firstName }.'); // My name is ${ firstName }.

console.log(`My name is ${ firstName }.`); // My name is Kyle.
```

Assuming this program has already defined a variable `firstName` with the string value `"Kyle"`, the `` ` ``-delimited string then resolves the variable expression (indicated with `${ .. }`) to its current value. This is called **interpolation**.
