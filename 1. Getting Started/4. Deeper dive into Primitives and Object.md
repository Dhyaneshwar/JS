# Primitive types & Objects

Javascript has 5 data types that are passed by **_value_**: `Boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `String`, and `Number`. We’ll call these **primitive types**.

Javascript has 3 data types that are passed by **_reference_**: `Array`, `Function`, and `Object`. These are all technically Objects, so we’ll refer to them collectively as **Objects**.

## Primitives

If a primitive type is assigned to a variable, we can think of that variable as _containing_ the primitive value.

```
var x = 10;
var y = 'abc';
var z = null;
```

`x` _contains_ `10`. `y` _contains_ `'abc'`. Let us imagine what these variables and their respective values look like in memory.

## Objects

Variables that are assigned a non-primitive value are given a **reference** to that value. That reference points to the object’s location in memory. The variables don’t actually contain the value.

When we write `arr = []`, we’ve created an array in memory. What the variable `arr` receives is the address, the location, of that array. Just like a string is denoted by quotation marks (`''` or `""`), an `address` will be denoted by arrow brackets, `<>`.

When we assign and use a reference-type variable, what we write and see is:

```
1) var arr = [];
2) arr.push(1);
```

A representation of lines 1 and 2 above in memory is:

Notice that the value, the address, contained by the variable `arr` is static. The array in memory is what changes. When we use `arr` to do something, such as pushing a value, the Javascript engine goes to the location of `arr` in memory and works with the information stored there.

### Assigning by Reference

When a reference type value, an object, is copied to another variable using `=`, the address of that value is what’s actually copied over as if it were a primitive. **Objects are copied by reference** instead of by value.

```
var reference = [1];
var refCopy = reference;
```

The code above looks like this in memory.

Each variable now contains a reference to the _same array_. That means that if we alter `reference`, `refCopy` will see those changes:

```
reference.push(2);
console.log(reference, refCopy); // -> [1, 2], [1, 2]
```

We’ve pushed `2` into the array in memory. When we use `reference` and `refCopy`, we’re pointing to that same array.

### Reassigning a Reference

Reassigning a reference variable replaces the old reference.

```
var obj = { first: 'reference' };
```

In memory:

When we have a second line:

```
var obj = { first: 'reference' };
obj = { second: 'ref2' }
```

The address stored in `obj` changes. The first object is still present in memory, and so is the next object:

When there are no references to an object remaining, as we see for the address `#234` above, the Javascript engine can perform garbage collection. This just means that the programmer has lost all references to the object and can’t use the object any more, so the engine can go ahead and safely delete it from memory. In this case, the object `{ first: 'reference' }` is no longer accessible and is available to the engine for garbage collection.

## == and ===

When the equality operators, `==` and `===`, are used on reference-type variables, they check the reference. If the variables contain a reference to the same item, the comparison will result in `true`.

```
var arrRef = [’Hi!’];
var arrRef2 = arrRef;
console.log(arrRef === arrRef2); // -> true
```

If they’re distinct objects, even if they contain identical properties, the comparison will result in `false`.

```
var arr1 = ['Hi!'];
var arr2 = ['Hi!'];
console.log(arr1 === arr2); // -> false
```

If we have two distinct objects and want to see if their properties are the same, the easiest way to do so is to turn them both into strings and then compare the strings. When the equality operators are comparing primitives, they simply check if the values are the same.

```
var arr1str = JSON.stringify(arr1);
var arr2str = JSON.stringify(arr2);
console.log(arr1str === arr2str); // true
```

Another option would be to recursively loop through the objects and make sure each of the properties are the same.
