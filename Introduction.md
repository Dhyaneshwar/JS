# JavaScript

- JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
- It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

## Compiled Language:

- A compiled language is a programming language that is converted from a high-level language into machine code so that the computer can execute it.
- This conversion is done by the compiler which scans the complete code only once and reports the errors collectively that the code might have.
  **Example:** C, C++, COBOL, etc.

## Interpreted language:

- An interpreted language is a programming language that is directly executed by the computer without any conversion to the machine-level language.
- The interpreter will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and halts at that very instance if there is some error.
  **Example:** JavaScript, Python, PHP, etc.

## First-Class functions:

A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function, and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

## Programming Languages:

Programming languages are high-level languages that need to be converted into machine-level language because a computer can only understand machine-level language or binary language (0 and 1).
Programming languages are most widely used to make software or drivers.
**Examples:** Java, C, C++, C#.

## Scripting Languages:

Scripting languages are basically the subcategory of programming languages that need to be interpreted instead of compiled.
Scripting languages are most widely used to create a website.
**Examples:** JavaScript, PHP, Perl, etc.
